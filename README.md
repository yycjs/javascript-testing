[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yycjs/javascript-testing.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yycjs/javascript-testing)

A [recent poll by DailyJS](http://dailyjs.com/2012/12/24/javascript-survey-results/) showed that only 50% of people test their JavaScript. If you're not testing your code you're a straight up amateur. This session is all about testing. We cover an intro to testing in general. How to write testable code, what tools are available and how you can become a pro at testing both your server and client side code. The slide deck can be found [here](http://yycjs.com/javascript-testing) and some awesome examples are [here](https://github.com/yycjs/javascript-testing/tree/gh-pages/examples). This is a session we are quite proud of, so do yourself a favour and check it out!
